# CureLang: A Symbolic-AI Framework for Discovering the Cure for HIV

**Author:** Guide Alison Sande  
**Subtitle:** Redefining the Search for a Cure through Computation, Abstraction, and African Innovation

---

## 📄 Overview

**CureLang** is a novel research initiative that reimagines HIV as a **symbolic process**, not just a biological one. It introduces a **formal language** and symbolic AI framework for modeling the HIV lifecycle, simulating immune system interactions, and testing cure strategies through logic-based computation.

This project blends:
- Symbolic logic and automata theory
- AI modeling (with a focus on explainability)
- Medical abstraction
- African innovation and leadership

## 🧠 Core Idea

> What if curing HIV wasn’t just about lab work — but about discovering the *underlying language* of the virus?

CureLang aims to model HIV’s behavior through **states, transitions, and symbolic encodings** — making the virus computable. This allows for:
- Mathematically testable hypotheses
- Simulated treatment pathways
- New drug strategies derived from symbolic patterns

## 📁 What's in This Repository?

- 📄 [`CureLang_HIV_WhitePaper.pdf`](./CureLang_HIV_WhitePaper.pdf): The full white paper introducing the framework and vision.
- 🧪 `prototype/`: (Coming soon) Simulations and language encodings for early models.

## 🔭 Vision

Africa is often the subject of research. With CureLang, it becomes the **source of innovation**. This project invites a new generation of thinkers — especially African coders, scientists, and visionaries — to pioneer a cure for HIV using **first-principles reasoning and computational logic**.
